Question: When I run "sudo python shim.py" command in shim/ folder. 
          I get this error: "socket.gaierror: [Errno -2] Name or service not known"
Answer:   Please make sure that the /etc/hostname file contains just the name of the machine.
For example if your machine name is "mininet-vm", the file should contain the exact name.

That /etc/hosts has an entry for localhost and machine name:
127.0.0.1    localhost
127.0.1.1    mininet-vm
