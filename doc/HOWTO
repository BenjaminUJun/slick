This document describes how to write Slick Elements and Applications.

Slick Elements:
---------------
A slick Element performs packet processing on packets handed by the shim layer.
Writing a Slick Element does not require knowing the shim layer, application or controller information.

To implement a Slick Element the programmer need to implement following functions.

i- init(fd,params)
    This function has the code that should have logic for initializing the slick element.
    In the simplest form this code will start an executable with user provided initialization parameters.
    @args:
        fd: It is an integer value representing the Element instance.
        params: Its a map of key value pairs. 

ii- configure(params)
    All the configuration related to programmin
    @args:
        params: Its a map of key value pairs. 

iii- process_pkt(self,buf)
    This function should have the implementation for packet processing.
    Packets belonging to the same flow will come to same Element instance.
    @args:
        buf: Its byte packet buffer with Ethernet frame.

iv- shutdown(self)
    This function should have code for gracefully shutting down the Element instance to reclaim resources
    on middlebox hardware.
