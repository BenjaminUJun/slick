This directory has different aspects of experimental code for slick controller.

click-mininet:
    This project is copied from here:
    https://github.com/basus/click-mininet
    We have made some modifications to be able to have not errors while running test.py and sandbox.py.
    Even though the click router is loaded we cannot ping the hosts or perform a wget. Needs more work.
