pcap module - a wrapper for Packet Capture library - version 1.0
================================================================

Description
===========

This module intends to be an exhaustive wrapper for the well known
Packet Capture library. It defines 3 new objects:
- pcap object which is a wrapper for `pcap_t' of PCAP library
- pcap dumper object which is a wrapper for `pcap_dumper_t' of PCAP library
- bpf_program object which is a wrapper for `struct bpf_program' used in
  PCAP library

Module defines only one exception: `error'. This exception is accompagnied
with a string value which is generally the error message generated by
PCAP library.

See PCAP library documentation (http://www.tcpdump.org) for more details
and have a look in subdirectory examples.

Basic Installation
==================

  To build pcap:

  0. You need to have PCAP library installed on your system

  1. `cd' to the toplevel directory of the package and run the command:

     $ python setup.py build_ext

  2. To make html documentation, run:

     $ python setup.py doc

     It simply runs pydoc on module pcap and create an html file
     pcap.html. If you have epydoc module installed, you can
     alternatively run:
