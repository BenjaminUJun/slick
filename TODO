Compiler:
---------
-> Compiler to read programs and generate application code. There should be option to read the program and generate code, and the option to write custom application.
-> Separate the Slick applications from the controller so that they can be run independently, even on a separate host. 

Function Specs:
---------------
-> Read the function specification conformance on the controller code.

Routing:
---------
-> Code placement algorithm for the initial placement of a middle box function.[On first flow]
-> Design and code algorithm for dynamically adjusting placement of a middle box function based on changes in traffic dynamics. This optimization would prove useful in situations where traffic from more end points are redirected through the middle box function.  For example, at time t0 traffic is between only one pair of end points but at time t1 there are now 10 points at different locations. It may be more beneficial, in terms of latency, to move the middle box function to a location that is central to all 10 points.
-> Modify Route setup function and ensure that it works for networks with more than one switch
-> Test Slick on networks with loops 
-> Test Slick on non-tree networks

Policy Conflicts:
------------------
-> Policy conflicts and overlaps, how can we have these policy issues resolved.


Design/Implementation Suggestion:
-----------------
-> Use Openflow version of shim layer that can be used with the controller and maintain MB MACs at the controller.
-> Inband Middlebox traffic handling.
-> Shim Layer in C/C++.[ For SOSP need C/C++]
-> Use POX controller instead of NOX.   
-> Need the ability to link Function code written in C/C++,Python and other languages.

Policy to Flow Conversion:
---------------------------
1- Currently we use the port numbers to identify the traffic, if its not identifiable by port need DPI.
2- What if we need DPI to understand the traffic, adding a single protocol detection might mean sending all the traffic to the DPI box

Functions to Add:
-----------------
       Any specific functions?
       1- HTTP header rewriting, use the CherryProxy
       2- Use the nDPI library with the C/C++ and with Python CTypes.

Misc.
-----
-> Trust relationship between the middleboxes.
-> Add function code downloading ability?

Future:
---------
Improving the Implementation:
   Using the wireshark decoding protocol.

Slick Contributions
*****************************


Programming Model:
-----------------
1- Slick provides a programming model.
    Tradtionally adding a new functions inside the network has been thought as adding a new Middlboxes in the network. 
    Slick provides a model for adding new functions in a network instead of adding Middleboxes.
    In current networks adding a new function in the network means looking for a middlebox with functionality 'X'
    and then adding its support in the network. If we we have to use a single function provided by the middlebox we have to 
    deselect some of the functions provided by the middlebox if Middlebox allows and then use the function.  
    
    Trying to compare click with Slick. While thinking about these differences:
    Click Server = Slick Network
    Click Element = Slick Function
    Click Configuration = Slick application.

    I see the following differences.
    i- Click provides a programming model where different elements can be put togther into a single graph. But Click's model is available
    for a single machine where all the elements stay on the same machine. In Slick graph nodes can reside on different machine. Which 
    means Click does not have to think about Function Placement and Traffic Steering.[This makes me think perhaps adding the function placement
    and traffic steering algorithm in Programming Model is the right choide?]
    ii- All Click elements run on the same hardware x86/network processor/fpga etc. while slick functions can run on different platforms.[Heterogeneity:Similar to LEGO;but network/host level]
    iii- In Click if there are three elements connected as shown below:
                     B
                  /
                /
        A --- /-
              \
                \
                  \
                    C
        Then the logic that needs to redirect the packet to Element B/C must be embedded in the element A. But in Slick we use OpenFlow switch or Shim Layer to redirect the
        traffic. [This point is similar to LEGO where redirection logic is not stored in CPP but in OpenFlow switch]
    iv- In click there is concept of "Hot Swapping" that can be used to load new configurations on the fly. This kind of concept is unnatural for the networks where
        modifying network configuration means adding or removing a node from a configuration. Slick uses that and can add new node or remove nodes. [One can say this is the general enough concept in the networks]
    v- In Click there is no 'Oracle' that could tell where to send the traffic next but in Slick there is controller that tells the next hop of traffic.[Similar to OpenFlow/LEGO and a long list]
    vi-  We have not discussed this thing in detail in design but:
        Click has: 
            1-to-m mapping between configuration and elements.
        In Slick there is:
            1-to-m mapping between application and functions. But we also need:
            m-to-1 mapping between applications  and a function. [An example might be a specific Functionlaity that is expensive enough that all the applications have to use that function.]
            m-to-n ??

Optimization Algorithm:
-----------------------
2- Optimization Algorithm that can be used to place functions and steer traffic using available hardware in the network. Implementing optimization algorithm does not need the abstraction for supporting for the Switches and Middlboxes.



Abstraction:
------------
3- There is abstraction that can be used to increase the feasible solution space for the optimization algorithm and 
we need to add the support for middlebox functions and different versions of Openflow switches.



Policies:
---------
4- There are policies. Overlapping and Conflicts.
    Overlap: Arises when 2 policies wants to send same flow to 2 different boxes. [match]
    Overlap: Its not an overlap when 2 policies want to send the same flow to one box. But can it cause multiple copies?
    Conflict: arises when 2 policies want to have 2 functions on the same flow. [function]

    How do we statically analyze them to figure out the conflicts.
    -> Policy A: If there is a policy that says that send all the DNS traffic for the DNS blocking.
    -> Policy B: Send all the traffic of a subnet 192.168.10.* to DPI box for further analysis. 
    Implementing Policy A and Policy B in the network at one time means that all the DNS flows from subnet 192.168.10.* should be sent to DNS box and to DPI box. This has two solutions:
      i- Send the subnet DNS flows to DPI box and DNS box and then drop flows at one of the box.
      ii- Send the traffic to the one box and then to other box.This solution makes more sense.[Serialize]
