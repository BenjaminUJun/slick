MiddleSox Code

lib:
    System required libraries the are required to be installed before.

dns-dpi:
    has code for dns packet handling exaqmple, which works separately from the shim code.

p0f:
    will have code for p0f based traffic function.

comm:
    Provide the utiltiy functions to talk with the controller.

logger:
    has code the logger function.

shim:
    This folder has the shim layer code/
        shim.py is responsbile for getting the packets and calling respective process_pkt() for the function.
        mb_api.py is responsioble for the interface to the controller.

controller:
    This folder has the copntroller side code, There are three main files in this:
        pyswitch.py:  It acts as the controller for the applications.
        msmessageproc.py: This has the application classes
        networkmaps.py: has flow to function mapping. It also has function and machine maps.


POX Invocation:
--------------
./pox.py --verbose samples.spanning_tree --forwarding=l2_multi

Running the Slick Controller.
./pox.py --verbose samples.spanning_tree --forwarding=l2_multi slick.slick_controller
# Start the slick controller
# Start the SlickMessageProcessor
#Start the L2 packet forwarding after starting spanning tree module.
sudo ./pox.py --verbose slick.slick_controller messenger slick.tcp_transport --tcp_address=127.0.0.1 --tcp_port=7790 samples.spanning_tree --forwarding=l2_multi

To tun code with non pcap traffic use command:
sudo ./pox.py --verbose slick.slick_controller messenger slick.tcp_transport --tcp_address=10.0.0.254 --tcp_port=7790 samples.spanning_tree --forwarding=l2_multi
set OPEN_FLOW_CONTROLLER = 10.0.0.254 in the constants.py file.


Running the Middlebox Functions:
--------------------------------
For the real interface.
sudo python shim.py -i eth0 -o eth0
or
sudo python shim.py -i eth0 -o eth1

#python shim.py

python shim.py -f <file_name>.pcap -o eth0
